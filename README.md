Some notes are only related to each other by their chronology. This webapp is a simple way to take those notes. Inspired by ideas by [Samson Zhang](https://twitter.com/wwsalmon).

Built on Next.js and MongoDB.

To run locally, clone this repo then create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

-   MONGODB_URL
-   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
-   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
-   NEXTAUTH_URL

Then run `npm run dev` in the root directory.
